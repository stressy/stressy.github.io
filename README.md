# Instructions

## Game round
Stress is quite special unlike other games. In Stress, both players play at the same time and as fast as they want. 
Color does not matter in this games.

## General rules
Once the cards in the middle (1 from each deck) are dealt both players can deal their own cards on top of them. But this can only be done if the player's card is a denomination higher or lower than the game stack. So if there is a 4 in one pile and one player has a 5, 6 and a 9 then the player can first put a 5, then a 6. But the player may not add his 9 to the game pile becouse the 9 is not a denomination higher or lower of a 7. Ace counts as 14 and 1 so you can only add it on a king or a 2.

## Refilling of cards
When you lay cards, new cards from the player's deck of cards will move to your action cards.

## Stress
If both cards in the middle have equal numbers a "STRESS" button will be displayed at a random position. Hit the button and your enemy will gets both piles added to their deck.

## Goal
To get rid of all your cards.
